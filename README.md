# Sort-Files-By-Extension
Input an old directory and a new directory to recursively loop through the old directory and sorts each file into their own folders based on the file's extension in the new directory.

Usage:
- Python is required for this to work
- You may simply run the Python file e.g by double clicking the file and you will be prompted to enter 2 directories, one to copy FROM and the other to copy TO
- You can also run the Python file via the command line and supply system arguments
- To run via the command line, cd to the directory of the Python file. Then use `py ./sort-files-by-extension.py` and supply optional parameters
